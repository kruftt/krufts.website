We'll start in 0 dimensions and work our way up. At each level we'll look at points within the space and operations on them, before coming to focus on rotations and then on 3D rotations in particular. At the end we'll look forward toward what's called the Clifford or geometric algebra, which further clarifies and builds on the story presented here."}]

If this is your first introduction to the topic, expect to require other materials to be able to follow through the whole thing! This is intended to be a supplement, rather than a replacement. I've tried to emphasize algebraic and geometric perspectives that I've found useful both for my own mathematical intuition building and for working with 3d software tools and libraries, but I hope this article can be enjoyed by anyone interested in quaternions for whatever reason!"}]
