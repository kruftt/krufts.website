I'd like to present a mathematical story about a way that quaternions could have been motivated and discovered, and which leads naturally into motivating the geometric algebra. We'll start in 0 dimensions and work our way up. At each level we'll look at points within the space and operations on them, before coming to focus on rotations and then 3d rotations in particular. At the end we'll look forward toward the geometric algebra, which further builds on the ideas presented here."}]

I've tried to emphasize algebraic and geometric perspectives that I have found useful for my own intuition building and for working with 3d software tools and libraries, but I hope this article can be enjoyed by anyone interested in quaternions for whatever reason!"}]
