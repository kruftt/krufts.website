Here, if we take the square root of multiplication by the conjugate, just like in the pythagorean theorem, we will get the modulus. This is called the euclidean norm, because it gives the euclidean distance from the origin to a given point. I.e. it gives ",(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"r"}),", the scalar part of the action that could take a point from ",(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"0"})," to ",(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"p"}),"."]}),(0,r.jsx)(i.A,{children:"\\sqrt{zz^*} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = r"}),(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"flex justify-center mt-10 mb-6",children:(0,r.jsx)(d.default,{src:"quats/conjugate.png",className:"max-w-7/8 max-h-70",alt:"The complex conjugate."})})]})}},1620:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";function r(e){let{moduleIds:t}=e;return null}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"PreloadChunks",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}}),n(1834),n(4175),n(3475),n(3082)},1693:(e,t,n)=>{Promise.resolve().then(n.bind(n,1538))},1823:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{cn:()=>i});var r=n(9850),a=n(6576);function i(){for(var e=arguments.length,t=Array(e),n=0;n<e;n++)t[n]=arguments[n];return(0,a.QP)((0,r.$)(t))}},2074:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{A:()=>i});var r=n(1834);let a=(0,n(6145).default)(()=>n.e(9).then(n.bind(n,6390)).then(e=>e.MathJax),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:()=>[6390]},ssr:!1});function i(e){let{children:t,inline:n=!0}=e;t instanceof Array||(t=[t]);let i=t.map((e,t)=>n?(0,r.jsx)("span",{children:"\\("+e+"\\)"},t):(0,r.jsx)("span",{children:"\\["+e+"\\]"},t));return(0,r.jsx)(a,{className:"mt-4 mb-6",inline:!1,children:(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center",children:i})})}},2556:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{A:()=>i});var r=n(1834);let a=(0,n(6145).default)(()=>n.e(9).then(n.bind(n,6390)).then(e=>e.MathJax),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:()=>[6390]},ssr:!1});function i(e){let{className:t,children:n,dynamic:i}=e;return(0,r.jsx)(a,{inline:!0,dynamic:i,className:t,children:"\\("+n+"\\)"})}},2909:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return l}});let r=n(1834),a=n(8210),i=n(6409);function s(e){return{default:e&&"default"in e?e.default:e}}n(1620);let o={loader:()=>Promise.resolve(s(()=>null)),loading:null,ssr:!0},l=function(e){let t={...o,...e},n=(0,a.lazy)(()=>t.loader().then(s)),l=t.loading;function c(e){let s=l?(0,r.jsx)(l,{isLoading:!0,pastDelay:!0,error:null}):null,o=!t.ssr||!!t.loading,c=o?a.Suspense:a.Fragment,h=t.ssr?(0,r.jsxs)(r.Fragment,{children:[null,(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e})]}):(0,r.jsx)(i.BailoutToCSR,{reason:"next/dynamic",children:(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e})});return(0,r.jsx)(c,{...o?{fallback:s}:{},children:h})}return c.displayName="LoadableComponent",c}},3475:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"workAsyncStorage",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r.workAsyncStorageInstance}});let r=n(6269)},5290:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return a}});let r=n(5679)._(n(2909));function a(e,t){var n;let a={};"function"==typeof e&&(a.loader=e);let i={...a,...t};return(0,r.default)({...i,modules:null==(n=i.loadableGenerated)?void 0:n.modules})}("function"==typeof t.default||"object"==typeof t.default&&null!==t.default)&&void 0===t.default.__esModule&&(Object.defineProperty(t.default,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.assign(t.default,t),e.exports=t.default)},5402:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{i:()=>a});var r=n(1834);function a(e){let t,n,{children:a}=e;return"string"==typeof a?(t=a,n=!1):[t,n]=a,(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-10 mb-6",children:[(0,r.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-center m-auto text-3xl",children:t}),(0,r.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-center m-auto text-l mt-1",children:(0,r.jsx)("i",{children:n})})]})}},6145:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{default:()=>a.a});var r=n(5290),a=n.n(r)},6269:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"workAsyncStorageInstance",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}});let r=(0,n(843).createAsyncLocalStorage)()},6409:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";function r(e){let{reason:t,children:n}=e;return n}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"BailoutToCSR",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}}),n(1181)}},e=>{e.O(0,[787,738,30,358],()=>e(e.s=1693)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
