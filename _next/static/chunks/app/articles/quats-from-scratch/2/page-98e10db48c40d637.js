By undoing any sort of rotation we've ended up back in 1 dimension. All we have to do to get the original value of ",(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"r"}),' back is to take the square root. This distance from the origin is sometimes called the "Euclidean norm", where "norm" is a generalized term for distances and magnitudes. In broader contexts, the euclidean distance, calculated by summing the squares of the components, is referred to as the ',(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"L^2"})," norm (",(0,r.jsx)(a.A,{children:"L"})," named after Lebesgue)."]}),(0,r.jsx)(i.A,{children:"\\sqrt{zz^*} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = r"}),(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"flex justify-center mt-10 mb-6",children:(0,r.jsx)(h.default,{src:"quats/conjugate.png",className:"max-w-7/8 max-h-70",alt:"The complex conjugate."})})]})}},1620:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";function r(e){let{moduleIds:t}=e;return null}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"PreloadChunks",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}}),n(1834),n(4175),n(3475),n(3082)},1693:(e,t,n)=>{Promise.resolve().then(n.bind(n,1538))},1823:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{cn:()=>i});var r=n(9850),a=n(6576);function i(){for(var e=arguments.length,t=Array(e),n=0;n<e;n++)t[n]=arguments[n];return(0,a.QP)((0,r.$)(t))}},2074:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{A:()=>o});var r=n(1834),a=n(6145),i=n(1823);let s=(0,a.default)(()=>n.e(9).then(n.bind(n,6390)).then(e=>e.MathJax),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:()=>[6390]},ssr:!1});function o(e){let{children:t,inline:n=!0,className:a=""}=e;t instanceof Array||(t=[t]);let o=t.map((e,t)=>n?(0,r.jsx)("span",{children:"\\("+e+"\\)"},t):(0,r.jsx)("span",{children:"\\["+e+"\\]"},t));return(0,r.jsx)(s,{className:(0,i.cn)("mt-4 mb-6",a),inline:!1,children:(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"flex flex-col items-center",children:o})})}},2556:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{A:()=>i});var r=n(1834);let a=(0,n(6145).default)(()=>n.e(9).then(n.bind(n,6390)).then(e=>e.MathJax),{loadableGenerated:{webpack:()=>[6390]},ssr:!1});function i(e){let{className:t,children:n,dynamic:i}=e;return(0,r.jsx)(a,{inline:!0,dynamic:i,className:t,children:"\\("+n+"\\)"})}},2909:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return l}});let r=n(1834),a=n(8210),i=n(6409);function s(e){return{default:e&&"default"in e?e.default:e}}n(1620);let o={loader:()=>Promise.resolve(s(()=>null)),loading:null,ssr:!0},l=function(e){let t={...o,...e},n=(0,a.lazy)(()=>t.loader().then(s)),l=t.loading;function c(e){let s=l?(0,r.jsx)(l,{isLoading:!0,pastDelay:!0,error:null}):null,o=!t.ssr||!!t.loading,c=o?a.Suspense:a.Fragment,d=t.ssr?(0,r.jsxs)(r.Fragment,{children:[null,(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e})]}):(0,r.jsx)(i.BailoutToCSR,{reason:"next/dynamic",children:(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e})});return(0,r.jsx)(c,{...o?{fallback:s}:{},children:d})}return c.displayName="LoadableComponent",c}},3475:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"workAsyncStorage",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r.workAsyncStorageInstance}});let r=n(6269)},5290:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return a}});let r=n(5679)._(n(2909));function a(e,t){var n;let a={};"function"==typeof e&&(a.loader=e);let i={...a,...t};return(0,r.default)({...i,modules:null==(n=i.loadableGenerated)?void 0:n.modules})}("function"==typeof t.default||"object"==typeof t.default&&null!==t.default)&&void 0===t.default.__esModule&&(Object.defineProperty(t.default,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.assign(t.default,t),e.exports=t.default)},5402:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{i:()=>a});var r=n(1834);function a(e){let t,n,{children:a}=e;return"string"==typeof a?(t=a,n=!1):[t,n]=a,(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-10 mb-6",children:[(0,r.jsx)("h2",{className:"text-center m-auto text-3xl",children:t}),(0,r.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-center m-auto text-l mt-1",children:(0,r.jsx)("i",{children:n})})]})}},6145:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";n.d(t,{default:()=>a.a});var r=n(5290),a=n.n(r)},6269:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"workAsyncStorageInstance",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}});let r=(0,n(843).createAsyncLocalStorage)()},6409:(e,t,n)=>{"use strict";function r(e){let{reason:t,children:n}=e;return n}Object.defineProperty(t,"__esModule",{value:!0}),Object.defineProperty(t,"BailoutToCSR",{enumerable:!0,get:function(){return r}}),n(1181)}},e=>{e.O(0,[787,738,30,358],()=>e(e.s=1693)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
